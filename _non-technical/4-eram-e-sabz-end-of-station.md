This is the end of the Eram-e Sabz metro station. It goes towards Karaj which is city a near Tehran. It's the only place in the whole metro of Tehran that is beautiful. You can see the main bridges of Tehran that goes in and out: Like the veins of the city. Unfortunately the picture doesn't have a good quality.
