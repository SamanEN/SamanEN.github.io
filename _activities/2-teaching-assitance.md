I was a member of several teaching assistance courses. The most important one was the Advanced Programming course, under the supervision of Dr. Khosravi. I had the honor of organizing the course in partnership with my good friend, [Pasha](https://pashabarahimi.github.io/). We taught some of the course material to the students and supervised the TAs team to maintain course projects, assignment submissions, grading, and etc. You can find everything in the [course's Github](https://github.com/AP-ECE-UT/). Here's a short list of other courses I was TA:
  - Theory of Languages and Automata
  - Engineering Probability and Statistics
  - Introduction to Computing Systems and Programming
