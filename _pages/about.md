I'm currently in my final year of Computer Engineering at the University of Tehran. I love coding and find problems in computer networks and systems particularly intriguing. I've gained some [research experience](/research/) through internships at ETH Zurich and my home university. My passion leans more towards research than industrial work, though I’m especially interested in research that has direct applications in industry. I believe this is the most straightforward and effective way to see the impact of one's work on society.

My Research Interests
====

I am mostly interested in **Computer Systems** and **Computer Networks**. I am also very interested in the applications of Program Synthesis in Computer Networks, and I find research on SDNs and Programmable Networks particularly fascinating. While I’m still an undergraduate exploring my passions, these are fields where I have some experience and that I’ve enjoyed more than others.

My Interests in the world!

Beside Computer Science, you need other things to be classified as a living person. For me, it's mostly friends and family (such a cliché!). But beside that, I also love to take a walk in cities and meet people from different cultures and attitudes. I also like photography a lot. Unfortunately I'm an amateur in taking photos, and I don't have any special device for that. But I still try my best to capture photos with my phone. You can find some of the selected ones in the [Non-Technical](/non-technical) section.
