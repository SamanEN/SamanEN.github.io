I'm currently a last year student of Computer Engineering at the University of Tehran. I love to code, and I find problems in computer networks amd systems very interesting. I've had a little research experience as an intern, in ETH Zurich, and my home university. I'm mostly passionate about doing research rather than industrial employment. Although I'm **mostly** interested in researches that have direct use in the industry, as I believe that this is the shortest and easiest way to see the impact of your work on society.

My Research Interests
====

I'm mostly interested in the intersection of **Formal Methods** and **Computer Systems**. I don't find pure logic and verification much appealing; therefore, the emphasis is slightly more on the *Computer Systems* aspect. I have also studied **Program Synthesis** course from different sources, and I find its applications in **Computer Networks** very interesting.

My Interests in the world!

Beside Computer Science, you need other things to be classified as a living person. For me, it's mostly friends and family. But beside that, I also love to take a walk in cities and meet people from different cultures and attitudes. I also like photography a lot. Unfortunately I'm an amateur in taking photos, and I don't have any special device for that. But I still try my best to capture photos with my phone. ~~You can find some of the selected one in [Non-Technical](/non-technical) section.~~
